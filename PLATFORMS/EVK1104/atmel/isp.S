 * \brief AVR32 UC3 ISP.
 *
 * In order to be able to program a project with both BatchISP and JTAGICE mkII
 * without erasing the pre-programmed ISP, add this file to the project and
 * change the program entry point to _isp.
 *
 * The general-purpose fuses will have to be set to the value specified in the
 * ISP user's manual if JTAGICE mkII is used.
 *
 * - Compiler:           GNU GCC for AVR32
 * - Supported devices:  All AVR32UC devices can be used.
